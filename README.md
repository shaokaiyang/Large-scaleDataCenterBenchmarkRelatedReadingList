# Large-scaleDataCenterBenchmarkRelatedReadingList
This is a large-scale data center benchmark reading list maintained by **BUAA Cloud OS Group Member SKY**  

With the fast development of big data systems in recent years, a variety of open-source benchmarks have been built to evaluate and compare the workloads on these systems, and to promote their technology improvement. Benchmarking big data systems has become one of the most important driving forces for research and development efforts in a wide range of areas including data management systems, hardware architectures, operating systems, and programming systems. First, it helps to assess the progress in existing big data systems, thereby motivating their engineering efforts and guiding their performance improvement.Second, it helps to gauge the requirements of emerging big data applications, thus promoting the improvement of big data technology.The list presents  main papers about big data benchmark, which will guide your next research.

**The list is still incomplete and the categorization might be inappropriate.We will keep adding papers and improving the list. Any suggestions are welcome!**
